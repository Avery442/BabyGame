# Baby Game

A game designed for young children that they can play and hopefully distract them.

# Research

Based off research I have created a basic product with a flashing colour that can intrest children into interacting. I noticed with experience that children enjoy pressing keyboards (It causes dopeamine to rush to the brain when the keyboard interacts with them causing a sound or haptic feedback.)

My personal experience is better with the Macbook's Haptic Keyboard and Trackpad.

# Macscots

The mascots are created with DALL-E-3 using the ChatGPT platform.

# Potential Updates?

- Add Sound effects
- More mascots?
- Gamemodes?
